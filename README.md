# Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tommaso Azzalin, I'm a Computer Science master student at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en), Italy and had my bachelor's degree at [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/), Italy.

I'm currently working on my master thesis at [University of Karlstad](https://www.kau.se/en), Sweden.

You can also find me on [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommaso-azzalin/).

## Interests

I still consider myself a novice in the field but I love learning about Software Engineering and its applications, how applying good rules leads to good products! Nonetheless, I worked on many projects in the past few years so I have experience with many technologies, languages, tools and online platforms.

## Thesis

### SMacs SMart city system - Development of a cross-platform app
Description: Bachelor thesis on development of a cross-platform mobile app for managing traffic light devices.

## Projects

The following is a non-exhaustive and non-ordered by importance list of work I've done until now (some I cannot show since they're work-related, some are not worth showing but available on my GitHub profile, so just look out for them if you care) for university courses and personal needs. Most of them are unluckily in Italian but I believe source code is universal enough!  
You can find them split into different categories.
