# Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

My name is Tommaso Azzalin, I'm a Data Engineer at [Uddeholm](https://www.uddeholm.com/en/) (Hagfors, Sweden 🇸🇪).

I got my MSc in Computer Science at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) (Bologna, Italy 🇮🇹) and my BSc at [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/) (Padua, Italy 🇮🇹).

You can also find me on [![LinkedIn](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommaso-azzalin/).

## 🔭 Interests

I love learning about software and data engineering and their applications, how applying good rules leads to good products!  
Nonetheless, I worked on many projects in the past few years so I have experience with many technologies, languages, tools and online platforms.
