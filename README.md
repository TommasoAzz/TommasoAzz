# Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tommaso Azzalin, I'm a Computer Science master student at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en).

You can also find me on [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommaso-azzalin/).

## Interests

I still consider myself a novice in the field but I love learning about Software Engineering and its applications, how applying good rules leads to good products!

## Thesis

### [tesi-laurea-triennale](https://github.com/TommasoAzz/tesi-laurea-triennale)
Bachelor thesis on development of a cross-platform app for managing traffic management devices.

## Projects

The following is a non-exhaustive and non-ordered by importance list of work I've done until now (some I cannot show since they're work-related, some are not worth showing) for university courses and personal needs. Most of them are unluckily in Italian but I believe source code is universal enough!
